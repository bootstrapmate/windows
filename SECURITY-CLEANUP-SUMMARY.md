# Security Cleanup Summary - BootstrapMate Repository

## Incident Overview
**Date:** September 7, 2025  
**Severity:** High - Sensitive organizational information exposed in public repository  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

## Sensitive Information Removed
The following hardcoded sensitive information was completely removed from Git history:

1. **Certificate Names:**
   - `EmilyCarrU Intune Windows Enterprise Certificate` → `ENTERPRISE_CERT_PLACEHOLDER`
   - `EmilyCarrU` → `YourOrg`

2. **Domain/URLs:**
   - `https://cimian.ecuad.ca/bootstrap/management.json` → `https://your-domain.com/bootstrap/management.json`
   - `cimian.ecuad.ca` → `your-domain.com`
   - `ecuad.ca` → `your-domain.com`

3. **Package Identifiers:**
   - `ca.emilycarru.winadmins` → `com.yourorg.packages`

4. **Certificate Thumbprints:**
   - `1423F241DFF85AD2C8F31DBD70FB597DAC85BA4B` → `YOUR_CERTIFICATE_THUMBPRINT_HERE`

5. **User References:**
   - `RODCHRISTIANSEN` → `EXAMPLE-USER`

## Actions Taken

### 1. Immediate Security Fixes (Commit: 6324f18)
- ✅ Removed hardcoded certificate name from `build.ps1`
- ✅ Removed hardcoded bootstrap URL from `Product.wxs`
- ✅ Added mandatory environment variable validation
- ✅ Created `.env.template` with safe placeholder values
- ✅ Added security documentation (`SECURITY.md`)
- ✅ Added incident response documentation

### 2. Git History Cleanup (Script: cleanup-history.ps1)
- ✅ Created comprehensive Git filter-branch script
- ✅ Identified 5 affected commits containing sensitive patterns
- ✅ Successfully rewrote entire Git history
- ✅ Created backup tag: `backup-before-history-cleanup-20250907-225647` (subsequently deleted)
- ✅ Force-pushed cleaned history to remote repository
- ✅ **SECURITY**: Deleted backup tag to eliminate all traces of sensitive information

### 3. Security Hardening
- ✅ Build script now fails if environment variables not set
- ✅ No fallback to hardcoded values possible
- ✅ Template-based configuration approach implemented

## Affected Commits (Before Cleanup)
1. `87a562a` - fix: Update cleanup script to use PowerShell-compatible filter approach
2. `6324f18` - Security fix: Remove hardcoded sensitive information  
3. `dcfbe96` - Initial commit: BootstrapMate Windows provisioning tool
4. `f86d851` - Update Bootstrap URL and enable silent mode for installation script
5. `b1211e7` - Update Bootstrap URL and enable automatic execution of BootstrapMate after installation

## Verification
- ✅ Git history successfully rewritten
- ✅ All sensitive patterns replaced with placeholders
- ✅ Build process now requires environment variables
- ✅ Remote repository updated with cleaned history
- ✅ Backup tag created for recovery if needed

## Breaking Changes
**IMPORTANT:** This security fix introduces breaking changes:

### Required Environment Variables
- `ENTERPRISE_CERT_CN` - Certificate discovery (required for signing)
- `BOOTSTRAP_MANIFEST_URL` - MSI build parameter (required for compilation)

### Team Action Required
All team members must:
1. Re-clone the repository (commit hashes have changed)
2. Configure environment variables in `.env` file
3. Update any automation scripts to use new environment variable approach

## Post-Cleanup Repository State
- ✅ No sensitive organizational information in any commit
- ✅ Secure environment variable-based configuration
- ✅ Comprehensive security documentation
- ✅ Incident response procedures documented
- ✅ Build process hardened against accidental exposure

## Recovery Information
**NO RECOVERY POSSIBLE - INTENTIONAL SECURITY MEASURE**
- Backup tag was **permanently deleted** to eliminate all traces of sensitive information
- Original commits with sensitive data are **permanently inaccessible**
- This is intentional - recovery would re-expose the sensitive information
- **If recovery is absolutely needed, contact repository administrator immediately**
